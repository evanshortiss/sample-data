How to Replace Windows with Linux on Your TechGear Pro Laptop

Issue

You purchased a TechGear Pro Laptop and want to remove Windows to install Linux.

Solution

Step 1: Check Hardware Compatibility

Most Linux distributions work well with TechGear Pro Laptops. However, for the best experience, check:
	•	Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support
	•	Graphics driver compatibility (especially for NVIDIA or AMD GPUs)
	•	Touchpad and function keys behavior

Refer to your selected Linux distribution’s hardware compatibility list.

Step 2: Backup Important Data

Before making any changes, create a backup of important files using:
	•	An external USB drive
	•	Cloud storage
	•	A second internal drive (if available)

Step 3: Create a Bootable Linux USB Drive
	1.	Download a Linux ISO (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, or Arch Linux) from the official website.
	2.	Use Rufus (Windows) or balenaEtcher (cross-platform) to create a bootable USB drive (8GB or larger).

Step 4: Boot from the USB Drive
	1.	Insert the USB into your TechGear Pro Laptop.
	2.	Restart and press F12 (or Esc/F2 depending on the model) to access the boot menu.
	3.	Select your USB drive and boot into the Linux Live Environment.

Step 5: Install Linux & Remove Windows
	1.	Once in the Linux installer, select Erase Disk and Install Linux.
	2.	Follow the on-screen steps to configure partitions, user accounts, and settings.
	3.	Complete the installation and restart your laptop.

Step 6: Install Additional Drivers & Updates

After installation:
	•	Run sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade (for Debian-based distros) or dnf update (for Fedora).
	•	Install proprietary drivers if needed (e.g., sudo ubuntu-drivers install for NVIDIA).
	•	Configure additional settings like keyboard shortcuts and power management.

Troubleshooting
	•	No Wi-Fi? Use a wired connection or download drivers manually.
	•	Boot issues? Ensure Secure Boot is disabled in BIOS.
	•	Performance issues? Try a lighter distro like Xubuntu or Manjaro.
